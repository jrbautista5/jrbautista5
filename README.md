- ðŸ‘‹ Hello,
-  My name is Rueben Bautista and I am interested in developing custom statistical analysis that is served an easy-to-use format.  
-  I have been working on developing skills in project management and communications, but wish to return to the technical world.
-  My background is primarily with R's tidyverse and Python's Pandas libraries and I am looking to expand into machine learning. 
-  Currently, my goal is to become a more consistent programmer that can create reproducible research for others to use in their analyses.
-  To contact me, please reach out via email: rueben.bautista7@gmail.com
